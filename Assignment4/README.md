The assignment consists of building a feed forward neural network using Numpy and Keras. MNIST handwritten dataset has been used here.

1. Numpy:
   1. Build a 3 layer neural networks.
   2. Used Mini batch gradient descent 
   3. Activation layer of RELU and dropout of 0.50 used 
   4. Data sugmntation using datagen to improve accuracy
    
3. Keras:
   1. Model using static learning rate and Adaptive learning rate.
   2. Comparision between the performances on both strategies
